# WebScraper (OBSOLETE) [^1]

This is a Web Scraper made in Python using Beautiful Soup.
This was a small project that was programmed during the Laurier GoldenHack Hackathon in 2019.

[^1]: Unfortunately, this project was made years ago and as a result, some parts of this program are obsolete and no longer function. This is essentially meant to be displayed as a reference rather than usable code
